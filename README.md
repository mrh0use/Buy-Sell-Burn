# Buy-Sell-Burn
//buy sell burn is a gamified dapp that takes the popular game in which participants are forced to choose between "buy", "sell", and "burn" between 3 NFT or DeFi projects.  This dapp will consist of a wallet-connect and allow connected users to play the game.  Collected in-game information will be cross referenced with player wallet contents to gauge consumer sentiment. Active participants will earn points for completing each round and placed on a leaderboard.  Players can vote in 5 polls for free each day, before being given an option to pay for a "power up" and earn more votes.  Players leading in votes at the end of each play period or season may earn an NFT or otherwise sponsored prize.
//blockchain data and other browsing data may be collected by site users and anonymized for market research purposes to analyze consumer sentiment regarding web3 products and services.  This information may be sold to 3rd parties to assist in their consumer research and marketing efforts.
//### Components:

1. **Smart Contract**: This will handle the game logic, store the results, and manage the leaderboard.
2. **Frontend**: A user-friendly interface to interact with the smart contract.

### Smart Contract:

#### Data Structures:

- **User Struct**: 
  - Address
  - Points (number of rounds played)

- **NFT Struct**:
  - Image URL (from OpenSea or IPFS)
  - Buy count
  - Sell count
  - Burn count

- **Leaderboard**: A mapping of user addresses to their points, sorted by points.

#### Functions:

- **playGame**: Allows a user to select Buy, Sell, or Burn for three NFTs. Validates that each action is selected only once. Updates the counts for each NFT and awards the user a point.

- **getLeaderboard**: Returns the leaderboard.

- **getNFTData**: Returns data about the NFTs (for the dApp owners).

### Frontend:

- **Connect Wallet & Signature Authentication**: Using libraries like Web3.js or ethers.js, allow users to connect their EVM-compatible wallets and sign a message for authentication.

- **Game Interface**: 
  - Fetch 3 NFT images from OpenSea's API or IPFS.
  - For each NFT, provide options to Buy, Sell, or Burn.
  - Validate user choices (ensure each action is selected only once).
  - Submit choices to the smart contract.

- **Leaderboard**: Display the top players and their points.

### Workflow:

1. User connects their wallet and signs a message for authentication.
2. User clicks "Play" and is presented with 3 random NFT images fetched from OpenSea or IPFS.
3. User selects Buy, Sell, or Burn for each NFT.
4. Choices are validated and sent to the smart contract.
5. The smart contract updates the NFT counts and awards the user a point.
6. The frontend updates to show the user's new point total and displays the leaderboard.

### Considerations:

- **Privacy**: Only the dApp owners should access the results. This can be achieved by having specific functions in the smart contract that are only callable by the owner's address.

- **Spam Prevention**: Implement a cooldown period between game rounds for each user to prevent spamming.

- **Scalability**: As the number of users grows, consider optimizing the leaderboard to handle a large number of entries efficiently.

- **Data Collection**: Since you're interested in collecting browsing data, consider integrating analytics tools that respect user privacy. Ensure that users are informed about the data collection and obtain their consent.

- **NFT Image Retrieval**: When fetching images from OpenSea, use their API to get trending or popular NFTs. If using IPFS, you'd need a curated list of popular NFT image hashes to pull from.

This refined architecture should align more closely with your vision for the "Buy, Sell, or Burn" dApp. The next steps would involve detailed smart contract development, frontend development, and rigorous testing.
